**Goal** :  This study uses wireless range sensors to estimate the 3D relative location between the target and the robot, and control the mobile robot by tracking control algorithms.

***

**Summary**
Tracking control requires identifying target objects accurately, and ultra-wideband sensors are widely studied for their higher accuracy compared to other wireless ranging methods.    
    
This study includes the use of ultra-wideband sensors to identify the 3D trajectory of the target, mobile robot motion control, and tracking control. The ultimate goal is to enable tracking control-enabled mobile robots to be applied in service scenarios such as airports and factories.
