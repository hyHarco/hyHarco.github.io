Conference on Advanced Robotics and Its Social Impacts (ARSO 2023)
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the 19th IEEE International Conference on
Advanced Robotics and Its Social Impacts (ARSO 2023) that will take
place in Berlin, Germany, June 5th-7th 2023, in conjunction with ICRA’23.
Contributions for papers and organized sessions are now open (accepted
papers will be published in the conference proceedings and on IEEE Xplore).   
   
*** Summary ***
Advanced robots are expected to enter in promising applications in our
future society and bring substantial impacts. The increasing
implementation of AI-based components even broadens their fields of
application. To ensure that these impacts are positively reflected,
today, we need to extend views not only on technical aspects but also on
social challenges that we might face, which include safety, regulation,
ethics, human factors, and philosophy.   


*** Topics of interest ***
 * Human-robot interaction in physical & psychological aspects
 * Safety standards for advanced robots & autonomous systems
 * Legal and ethical issues for advanced robots
 * Impact of robotics on society, e.g. robot business, marketing &
 economic impact
 * Robotics for sustainability, climate change or civil aid
 * Advanced industrial robots for future manufacturing
 * Healthcare & medical applications
 * Rehabilitation and transfer robotics
 * Service & assistance applications
 * Entertainment & education robotics
 * Robotics & autonomous driving
 * Bio-inspired robotics
 * Soft and wearable robotics
