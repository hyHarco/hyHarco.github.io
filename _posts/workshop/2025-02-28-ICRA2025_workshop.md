Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the Call for Papers for our workshop, "How do Robots Care? Innovative Strategies and Interfaces for Physically Assistive Robots in Healthcare," which will be held during the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025 in Atlanta, USA, from May 19–23, 2025.

This workshop aims to advance the development of innovative and user-centric solutions for physically assistive robots in healthcare. We are seeking contributions that explore cutting-edge research and practical applications.

Submission Guidelines
We invite researchers and practitioners to submit **Extended Abstracts (2–4 pages)** or **Videos (max. 3min)**. Papers will undergo double-blind peer review, and selected works may be asked for oral presentations and/or poster sessions during the workshop.

We will address a diverse range of **topics** related to the theme of the workshop, including but not limited to:
* Monitoring of human cognitive and physical ergonomics
* Modeling of humans with mobility constraints
* Human movement and gait analysis
* Prediction of human intentions and actions
* Assessment of trust, comfort, and perceived safety in pHRI
* Human-centered design of physically assistive devices and interfaces
* Smart walking and mobility aids
* Customizable interfaces for physical assistance
* Co-adaptation and personalization of physically assistive robots
* Model-based and model-free control strategies for physical assistance
* Robot learning from human-human physical interaction
* Planning and decision-making for physical assistance
* Safety and robustness in physical assistance
* Design of explainable and trustworthy assistive behaviors \\
Challenges and requirements of in-home and in-hospital deployment of physically assistive robots
You can submit your contribution [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWteJxQAsAcowR1rqxx6C8m2Xzjo-4ugzbTl3FBOPu-xO00w/viewform).

## Important Dates
* **Submission Deadline:** 24th March 2025
* **Notification of Acceptance:** 3rd April 2025
* **Camera-ready Submissions:** 1st May 2025
* **Workshop Date:** May 19–23, 2025

## Why submitting?
* Share your research with a global audience and gain visibility. 
* Engage with leading experts and peers in the field. 
* Explore collaboration opportunities.
* Enjoy the talks of our esteemed speakers and discuss with them.
* Enjoy live demonstrations.
* Be eligible for the Best Paper, Best Poster/Presentation, or Best Video awards, funded by our distinguished sponsors.
* Visit the workshop website for more information about the workshop and submission details.

We look forward to receiving your contributions and seeing you at ICRA 2025!
