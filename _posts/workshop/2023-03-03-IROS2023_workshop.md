To achieve sustainable work one of the key elements is ergonomics which aims to design workspace processes in a way to promote efficiency and safety. The recent emergence of collaborative and wearable robots in workspaces presents a potentially powerful new tool for the field of ergonomics. The robot can anticipate and mitigate the physical risk factor related to work-related musculoskeletal disorders, for example, by incorporating human models into robot control to make it aware of the human co-worker's ergonomic status and actively reconfiguring the work process with the robot. 

To tackle major challenges and opportunities that have been recently identified by the community through a series of successful workshops we organised at IROS ([IROS2019](https://www.iit.it/web/hrii/iros2019-workshop), [IROS2020](https://www.iit.it/web/hrii/iros2020-workshop), [IROS2021](https://www.iit.it/web/hrii/iros2021-workshop), and [IROS2022](https://www.iit.it/web/hrii/iros-2022-b-workshop)) and ICRA ([ICRA2018](https://www.iit.it/web/hrii/icra2018-workshop)) in the past. So far, our focus was primarily on using traditional human physical and cognitive models and while these models tend to be reliable they are often difficult to personalise. On the other hand, the robotics community has made substantial progress on the topics of robot learning in the past decade, which offers great potential for model personalisation and enhanced adaptiveness of robots to facilitate ergonomics. 

The objective of the proposed workshop is to review the progress which was achieved since our last workshop and then focus on how robot learning methods can help with ergonomic human-robot collaboration. This agenda requires experts from various research fields and interdisciplinary discussions, thus we assembled a diverse set of organisers and speakers, who are leading experts in their respective areas highly relevant to the workshop topic.

  headline="Adaptation in human-robot collaboration"

  text="In this talk, I will present our experimental findings concerning the adaptation mechanisms that humans exhibit when physically interacting with a cobot during co-manipulation tasks. This knowledge is important to inform robotics controller that reason about the human ergonomics during collaboration. I will also show some software tools that we developed to assess and visualise ergonomics criteria online based on Digital Human Models."

  text="In this talk, I will focus on improving human-robot collaboration through investigating human dyads in workspaces. The interaction between humans and robots in shared workspaces presents numerous challenges that must be addressed to optimize their collaboration. In this context, studying human dyads in workspaces provides an effective means to understand and improve human-robot interaction. By exploring the dynamics of human dyads and the factors that influence their collaboration in shared workspaces, we can develop strategies to improve the effectiveness of human-robot collaboration. This talk will provide an overview of my current research on human dyads in workspaces and highlight the potential benefits of this approach for optimizing human-robot collaboration."

  headline="Industry 5.0: a multidisciplinary research approach?"

  text="Human-robot collaboration has great potential to face societal challenges (as ageing population, need for better and healthier work), sustainability requirements and economic needs (small lot sizes, reshoring,…). In this talk we will focus how we achieve a human centered approach by combining expertise of not only engineering/AI fields, but also human and social sciences. As such we achieve a higher acceptance of the technology by the use. We provide examples on collaborative robots and exoskeletons for improved ergonomics and sustainable self healing soft grippers.  At the VUB this work was performed in the Brussels Human Robotics Research Center, BruBotics, which is a joint initiative of 8 research groups of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) sharing a common vision: improve our quality of life through Human centered Robotics."

  headline="Learning Representations for Human-Robot Collaboration"

  text="There have been significant advances in the field of robot learning in the past decade. However, many challenges still remain when considering how robot learning can advance interactive agents such as robots that collaborate with humans. In this talk, I will be discussing the role of learning representations for robots that interact with humans and robots that interactively learn from humans through a few different vignettes. I will first discuss how bounded rationality of humans guided us towards developing learned latent action spaces for shared autonomy. It turns out this “bounded rationality” is not a bug and a feature — i.e. we can develop extremely efficient coordination algorithms by learning latent representations of partner strategies and operating in this low dimensional space. I will then discuss how we can go about actively learning such representations capturing human preferences including our recent work on how large language models can help design human preference reward functions. Finally, I will end the talk with a discussion of the type of representations useful for learning a robotics foundation model and some preliminary results on a new model that leverages language supervision to shape representations."

  headline="Promote workers’ safety and health through ubiquitous sensing during human-robot collaborative assembly tasks"

  text="In recent years, the topic of ubiquitous sensing has gained significant attention due to the availability of low-cost portable sensors, such as cameras and inertial measurement units. Through the use of ubiquitous sensing, human-centric intelligent systems can collect signals from sensors and perform context-aware computing based on human physical and cognitive activities. This talk will explore various applications of ubiquitous sensing, with a particular focus on promoting safety and health during human-robot collaborative assembly tasks. Specifically, we will discuss three applications: collision avoidance between human workers and collaborative robots, finding an optimal point of operation for robots to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal disorders for workers, and examining the impact of robot factors (such as end-effector movement path) on workers' mental stress."
