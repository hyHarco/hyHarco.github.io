**Goal** : This study predicts GAIT Phase, which shows strong performance in terrain and speed change.

***

**Summary**
CNN is a widely used artificial neural network in the field of computer vision, which captures characteristic distribution changes in data and is used to learn the rpresentation of images.   
    
The problem with the existing GAIT Phase research is that because Prediction was conducted with data collected from constant walking speed and topography, there is a lack of coping with the complex environment in which people are active.
   
This study attempted to solve these problems by conducting learning based on data collected from various terrain and speed environments.
