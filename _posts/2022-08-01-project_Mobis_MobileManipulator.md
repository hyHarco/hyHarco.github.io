The project aims to develop Whole-body control using Redundant Degree of Freedom in mobile manipulators so that workers can perform tasks reliably.  
The contents that our lab is developing are as follows.  
-Control method for mitigating impact when contact with the environment occurs.  
-Develop a dynamic decision algorithm in which the order of tasks is determined by priority.  
-An algorithm in which the behavior of a robot is determined by human work will or environmental
