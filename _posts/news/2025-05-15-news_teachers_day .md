Celebrating Teacher’s Day at HARCO Lab

On May 15th, HARCO Lab held a small celebration to honor Teacher’s Day in Korea. Lab members gathered to express their gratitude to our advisors and professors, recognizing their continuous guidance, support, and inspiration.

As part of the celebration, a cake and flowers were presented as tokens of appreciation. The event was a warm reminder of the important role that mentors play in both academic and personal growth.
