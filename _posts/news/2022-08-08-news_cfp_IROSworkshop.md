## Call for Contributions
We would kindly like to invite you to participate in IROS 2022 Workshop on Ergonomic Human-Robot Collaboration: How Cognitive and Physical Aspects Come Together. We will welcome prospective participants to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages) to be presented as posters. The manuscripts should use the [IEEE IROS two-column format](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php).
Each paper will receive a minimum of two reviews. The papers will be selected based on their originality, relevance to the workshop topics, contributions, technical clarity, and presentation. Accepted papers require that at least one of the authors register to the workshop.

A PDF copy of the manuscript should be submitted, contributions may be sent by e-mail.

## Objectives
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) constitute a significant proportion of occupational morbidity, lost workdays, and costs for concern in any workplace. To reduce potential occupational injuries, a safe working environment must be created, and all workers must understand, accept, and use the principles of ergonomics. The field of ergonomics has been instrumental in developing methods, tools, and solutions when considering cognitive and physical aspects, respectively. The study of physical ergonomics is concerned with human anatomic, anthropometric, physiological, and biomechanical characteristics as they relate to physical work systems. To anticipate and mitigate the physical risk factor related to WMSD, Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) techniques such as collaborative robots (cobots) or wearable assistive systems have been exploited at workplaces. Specifically, some of the major challenges and opportunities have been recently introduced to exploit the advanced technologies that HRC can be aware of the human co-worker's ergonomic status hence to reconfigure and improve the physical working conditions. Regarding the aspect of physical ergonomics on HRC, we previously organised the successful series workshops on this topic: introduce the field of ergonomic human-robot collaboration at [ICRA 2018](https://www.iit.it/it/web/hrii/icra2018-workshop), review the initial research progress based on the goals set at the first workshop, and identify major ongoing research problems at [IROS 2019](https://www.iit.it/it/web/hrii/iros2019-workshop), discuss the emerging research opportunities and challenges at [IROS 2020](https://www.iit.it/it/web/hrii/iros2020-workshop), and then discuss the potential applications and implications in real-world scenarios at [IROS 2021](https://www.iit.it/it/web/hrii/iros2021-workshop).

So far, the major aspect of ergonomics in HRC has been focused on the physical effect. However, every human action is orchestrated by a combination of brain activity and body interactions. The study of cognitive human factors is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system.
Therefore, now comes the time to discuss some level of mental or cognitive processing in combination with physical efforts, so that ideally physical and cognitive demands should be considered together when examining HRC tasks.

The proposed workshop will first review the progress of the research and development in the physical ergonomic human-robot collaboration which was achieved since the first workshop in 2018. Next, we will focus on how cognitive and physical ergonomics aspects come together in the HRC field. This agenda requires experts from various research fields and interdisciplinary discussions. For this purpose, we assembled a diverse set of organisers and speakers, who are leading experts in their respective areas that are highly relevant to this workshop topic.
