On August 5, 2025, **Prof. Moon Ki Jung** from Keimyung University visited Hanyang University ERICA and delivered a seminar on:  
*“Utilization of Musculoskeletal Simulation for Evaluating the Human Impact of Soft-Type Wearable Devices.”*  

In his lecture, Prof. Jung introduced the fundamentals of **computational musculoskeletal biomechanics**, focusing on how inverse dynamics and subject-specific modeling can be used to analyze human movement and estimate muscle forces. He explained how MRI-based musculoskeletal models and validation studies, such as Orthoload, provide reliable frameworks for orthopedic and rehabilitation research.
