#### <i class="fas fa-edit"></i>  **Goal of This Project**
Development of ergonomic human-robot collaboration technology that can predict human engineering status of workers in real time and improve risk factors through collaboration with robots.    

To do this, this study established **Five Scientific Objectives (SO)**
- **(SO.1)** : Understanding Human Engineering Risks in Dynamic Human-Robot-Environmental Interactions.
- **(SO.2)** : A Study on Human-Robot Collaboration Techniques to Prevent Musculoskeletal Diseases.
- **(SO.3)** : A Study on the Interface for Improving Human Engineering Elements Using Human Redundancy
- **(SO.4)** : A Study on the Human-Robot Sharing Control Method Considering Priority
- **(SO.5)** : Validation of ergonomic human-robot collaboration techniques.

#### <i class="far fa-edit"></i>  **Project Contents**   
To achieve **the Five Scientific Goals (SO)** of this study, **Five Work Package (WP)** were established, and detailed research contents such as robotics, ergonomics, artificial intelligence, and statistics were classified by task according to each research plan.

- **(WP.1)** : Investigate and analyze the factors that cause musculoskeletal disease rates by presenting a ergonomic evaluation model in a dynamic interaction situation.
- **(WP.2)** : Eradicating/reducing hazardous or detrimental factors to the operator through ergonomic prediction/action control.
- **(WP.3)** : Implementation of a feedback interface to reflect the human body's Redundancy behavior.
- **(WP.4)** : Behavior Prediction and Sharing Control Using Artificial Intelligence.
- **(WP.5)** : Integration of human-robot collaboration system considering human engineering,   
Experiments on the developed ergonomic model,   
Building an open database with sensor data.
