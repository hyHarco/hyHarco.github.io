#### <i class="fas fa-edit"></i>  **Goal of This Project**
As the elderly population increases in society, there is an increasing demand for the development of medical robot devices that can help the elderly and the disabled live independently or help them rehabilitate walking.    
    
Currently developed medical robot devices satisfy walking rehabilitation to some extent and enable daily life, but there are no control techniques tailored to the characteristics of various people, so muscle development is restricted during walking training or rehabilitation.    

To solve this problem, we will conduct a joint project with overseas institutions to study leading artificial intelligence technology and medical robot device design technology, and further cultivate global talents with competitive medical robot design and control technology in Korea.
