- Build a diverse dataset of handshake motions using integrated sensor data.- Design and develop an upper
- limb exoskeleton robot for delivering dynamic force feedback.
- Develop communication and power supply systems for implementing various handshake motions.
- Create a trajectory generation and impedance control algorithm for user-specific handshake motion.
- Construct an exoskeleton robot system in a virtual environment and develop associated communication technologies.

#### <i class="fas fa-edit"></i>  **Importance of the Research**

- Current haptic devices are primarily limited to hand-based applications.Expanding technology to other body parts is essential to enhance immersion and provide diverse user experiences.
- Haptic devices often provide limited force feedback, restricting their application. Integrating stronger force output in wearable robots is critical.
- Existing wearable robots mainly focus on rehabilitation or assistance, lacking high responsiveness necessary for advanced haptic applications.
s- Heavy weight in both wearable and haptic devices hampers user convenience. Therefore, developing lightweight wearable robots integrated with haptic functionality is imperative.
