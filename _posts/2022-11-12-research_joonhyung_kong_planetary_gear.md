**Goal** : This study is an algorithm that makes it easy to switch between active or passive gear mode changes through hardware design that combines planetary gear and gear break.    
This will reduce the power consumption of exoskeleton robots by adjusting the control algorithm according to human behavior patterns.

***

**Summary**
The exoskeleton suit, which can produce great power, uses a lot of power at all times, so the drive time is short or large.     
    
This study attempted to reduce power consumption by adding passive driving to sections that do not require much power in the sequence of human movement.    
   
The active/passive mode of the gearbox changes depending on the motor restraint, which reduces power consumption and increases battery running time.
