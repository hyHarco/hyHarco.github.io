**Goal** :  Enhancing the dynamic adaptability of Mobile Manipulators, developing multiple motion strategies for human intent, ensuring human safety, and enhancing the naturalness of the collaboration process. 


***

**Summary**
This research is to develop a human-robot interaction strategy for Mobile Manipulator, which is human-centered, recognizes the intention through human movement and performs human-robot collaborative control or human avoidance control according to the human intention, and at the same time, divides the human body into HRC and avoidance regions according to the recognition content to ensure the safety during the human-robot interaction process.
