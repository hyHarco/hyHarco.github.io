**Goal** :  This study aims to develop a quantitative evaluation formula for walking across various terrains and to use it to propose control strategies for wearable robots

***

**Summary**
This study proposes a Modified Gait Index (MGI) to quantitatively evaluate walking across various terrains such as ramps and stairs. Gait data collected using motion capture, IMU, EMG, and force plates were analyzed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The MGI formulas were derived based on key joint features and clinically meaningful indicators such as the stance-to-swing ratio. The results showed that MGI maintains strong generalizability across terrains and can be effectively applied to adaptive control strategies for wearable robots.
