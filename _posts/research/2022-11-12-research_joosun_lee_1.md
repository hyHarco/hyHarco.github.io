**Goal** : Collision-Free Target Grasping in Complex and Cluttered Environment for Efficient Task and Motion Planning

***

**Summary**
The robot updates the path through the RRT algorithm in every step while moving toward the target as removing the obstacle or avoiding it.

**Topic**    
 * Motion Planning
 * TAMP
