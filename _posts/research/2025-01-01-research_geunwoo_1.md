**Goal** :  To develop adaptive control strategies that enable safe and efficient collaboration between humans and robots in shared workspaces.


***

**Summary**
This research focuses on designing adaptive controllers that facilitate physical interaction between humans and robots while ensuring safety and task efficiency. By dynamically adjusting to the humanâ€™s behavior and environment uncertainties, the controller maintains stability and performance during cooperative tasks.
