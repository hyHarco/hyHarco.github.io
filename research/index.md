# <i class="fas fa-robot"></i> **Research**



Our lab has various motion capture equipment such as **Optitrack**, **Xsens**, **Axis Neuron**, and also has a motion analysis software **Anybody S/W**, **foot pressure measurement equipment**, and **Force Plate**.
also, we have **Franka Panda Robot Arm**, **Mobile Manipulator** and **Holo Lenz**

    
We can provide various support for research with these equipment.    
The main research robot platforms in our lab are **Mobile Manipulators** and **Exoskeleton Robots**.

# **Exoskeleton Robot Research**
{% capture text %}

The shape of a human body is different in all the populations of the world. One of the most difficult things about properly controlling exoskeleton robots is that they need to be controlled flexibly, depending on the diversity of these individuals.  
In our lab, we're studying how to analyze these variations with AI technology and use it appropriately for robot control
