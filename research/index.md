# Exoskeleton Robot Research
{% capture text %}

<!-- 채워주셔야할 부분 -->
The shape of a human body is different in all the populations of the world. One of the most difficult things about properly controlling exoskeleton robots is that they need to be controlled flexibly, depending on the diversity of these individuals.  
In our lab, we're studying how to analyze these variations with AI technology and use it appropriately for robot control
