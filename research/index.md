### *AI Lower Exoskeleton Robot Control Project*    
The shape of a human body is different in all the populations of the world. One of the most difficult things about properly controlling exoskeleton robots is that they need to be controlled flexibly, depending on the diversity of these individuals.  
In our lab, we're studying how to analyze these variations with AI technology and use it appropriately for robot control

# <i class="fas fa-crosshairs"></i> **Mobile Manipulator Research**

### *Mobile Manipulator Project*
In our lab, research on mobile manipulators is being conducted in various ways under the theme of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).
Working with mobile manipulator robots and workers can make it easier to perform tasks, or they can do certain tasks on behalf of people.
