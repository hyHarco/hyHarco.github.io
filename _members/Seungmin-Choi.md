I am interested in Physical Human Robot Interaction (PHRI), which utilizes control theory and robotics. Using Robotics and classical control theory, we are working on a project to implement force control of robots and apply various control techniques.    
     

The ultimate goal of my research is not to specialize in specific tasks, but to make robots capable of performing various tasks skillfully, and to that end, I am studying Robotics and classical and state-of-the-art control techniques.
