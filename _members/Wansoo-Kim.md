# Research Interests
Wansoo Kim received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Hanyang University ERICA campus, Korea in 2008 and PhD degree in mechanical engineering from Hanyang University, Korea in 2015 (Integrated MS/PhD program). He was a post-doctoral researcher at Human-Robot Interfaces and Physical Interaction Lab, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Italy from 2016 to 2021. He is an assistant professor with Robotics Department, Hanyang University ERICA, Republic of Korea. He has developed several exoskeleton systems and collaborative robot (Cobot), and conducted research on the control of the powered exoskeleton robot and ergonomics collaboration control with Cobot through the physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) knowledge. He was involved in a Horizon-2020 project SOPHIA (No. 871237) and an European Research Council project Ergo-lean (No. 850932). He has contributed to several projects in the field of exoskeleton robot in Korean projects (Development of Wearable Robot for Industrial Labor Support, etc.) He was the winner of the Solution Award 2019, the winner of the KUKA Innovation Award 2018, of the HYU best PhD paper award 2015, and of the ICCAS best presentation award 2014. His research interests are in Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), human-robot collaboration, Shared Control, Ergonomics, Human modelling, Feedback devices, and powered exoskeleton robot.
