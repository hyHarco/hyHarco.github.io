# Research intersts
The researcher is currently researching a control framework that enables robots to adapt flexibly to various tasks in complex environments where humans and robots coexist. To achieve this, the researcher is interested in research that approaches the following research topics from a differential geometric perspective:
- Geometric Deep Learning for Complex Human and Robot Dynamics in Constrained Environments (nonholonomic, contact, etc.)
- Lie Group and Manifold Representations in Learning and Control
- Motion Planning and Optimal Control on Riemannian Manifolds
- Human-Robot Interaction via Structured Learning on Geometric Spaces
