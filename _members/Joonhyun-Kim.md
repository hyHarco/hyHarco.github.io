I'm interested in AI and robot control theory.
I have experience in supervised learning using Classical ML/DL techniques,  
and based on these, I am working on a project to apply them to Robot Control and Optimize various parameters.    
     
The ultimate goal of my research is to make the AI robot agent that performs a specific tasks through reinforcement learning,   
and to this end, I am studying various robot Control Methods(Impedance Control, Admittance Control) and AI algorithms.
