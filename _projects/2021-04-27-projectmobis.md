The project aims to develop Whole-body control using Redundant Degree of Freedom in mobile manipulators so that workers can perform tasks reliably. The contents that our lab is developing are as follows:
- Control method for mitigating impact when contact with the environment occurs.  
- Develop a dynamic decision algorithm in which the order of tasks is determined by priority.  
- An algorithm in which the behavior of a robot is determined by human work will or environmental changes.
